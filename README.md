Weather App using Code Explained's Youtube tutorial

The Weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18 C) in Celcius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (London, GB)

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celcius and Fahrenheit.

The API provider is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org
